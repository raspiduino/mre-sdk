## RGB565 Color Picker
Colors in MRE apps are generally stored in an RGB565 format. To generate colors in this format, use one of the tools from the list below:
- https://chrishewett.com/blog/true-rgb565-colour-picker/
- https://www.barth-dev.de/online/rgb565-color-picker/
- https://trolsoft.ru/en/articles/rgb565-color-picker

### Usage:
Assume you have a line of code which assigns a color to a color struct like this:
```c
color.vm_color_565 = VM_COLOR_RED;
```

- Generate a color using one of the tools from the list above.
- Instead of `VM_COLOR_RED`, paste in the RGB565 code generated by the tool (eg. `0x3186`, which is a dark shade of gray)

Now the code should look like this:
```c
color.vm_color_565 = 0x3186;
```
