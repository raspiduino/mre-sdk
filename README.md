# MRE SDK Development Resources
An archive of the MRE Software Development Kit and related resources in case someone needs it.

## Where can I get the SDK?
Go to [Release](https://github.com/raspiduino/mre-sdk/releases)

## What is MRE?
It is an SDK for [S30+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_30%2B) platform developed by Mediatek.

## Why not download from its official site?
That website was taken down :( (You can still view it from [WayBack machine](https://archive.org/web), but you cannot download anything from it.)
The reason why it was taken down is that MRE failed in the market. Nokia phones often use J2ME Java framework for running apps, but this series use MRE to write C++ apps, so it breaks the compatibility!

*Why it changed?* Microsoft bought Nokia and decided not to taking care about J2ME things and instead use a new framework licensed from Mediatek.

<hr>
I believe that anyone have the right to develop and run their software on their devices. I myself have a Nokia 220 and a Nokia 225, and have wondered how to develop/crack apps on these phones since I were small :)

So that's why I made a backup here.

I also believed someone always want to do this, but couldn't found the SDK.

I opened the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/raspiduino/mre-sdk/discussions) so you can talk about your apps :)
Happy coding!
